# PhoneHome, a risk management app for AWW 2014
## Mitchell Harper

This application will be used by Admissions Workshop Weekend leadership for the University of Washington Dream Project to manage laptops checked out from university departments. Also included is the ability track laptops as they "Phone Home," or submit ajax requests to ensure connection to the UW network during the event and prevent loss of equipment.
